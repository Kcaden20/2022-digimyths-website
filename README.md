## What is DigiMyths?
Third-culture kids, or individuals who were raised in a culture other than that of their parents and family or their ethnic background, often have a deeply complex sense of who they are and where they belong; i.e. in a place that exists in concept only. Deepened by the impact of COVID-19, this place fades as connecting with family in-person and trips to visit their familial lands become sporadic or inaccessible, and holding on to oneâ€™s heritage becomes harder.
This initiative emerged out of a desire to support and explore this place as a means of reconnecting with that heritage through contextualizing customs and stories and expanding understanding without geo-physicality.

## How Does DigiMyths Take Form?
Initiatives take different iterations based on capacity, opportunity and availability of collaborators. Making sure that anyone involved in the programs are compensated for their time and supported is the biggest priority.

_DigiMyths has been:_
