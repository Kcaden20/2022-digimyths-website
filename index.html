						<h2>What is DigiMyths?</h2>
						<p>As first-generation citizens, third-culture kids, or others with a familial attachment to another country, this other place often exists as an idea in our own heads. Complicated even further by COVID-19, the place begins to fade as frequent summer trips become sporadic, and maintaining one’s heritage becomes harder. What is Digital Folklore? While it’s definitions are amorphous, one way to see it is as a manner reconnecting with that heritage through understanding customs, stories, and beliefs without the need for geo-physicality. Join Kevin Cadena, BabyCastles’ Digital Folklorist-in-Residence for a DigiMyths: a program on the intersection of digital technologies, heritage, and familial stories. 
							<br><br>
						</p>
						<h3>How Will It Be Structured?</h3>
						<p>
							The participants and instructor will convene on Zoom to start the program in early February, and to end the program in late February. During these two weeks, participants will research mythologies related to their homeland and/or culture, sketch out potential ideas melding computer technologies into these stories, produce drafts to actualize their concepts and create self-driven projects that explore their own interpretation of  Digital Folklore. To further supplement their projects, The instructor will host a series of co-working sessions on Wednesdays between the two weeks for those who need time set aside and gather resources and materials that showcase some ways that artists have recontextualized their heritage through digital media. There will also be a discord server set up for the program to communicate asychronously. 
							<br><br></p>

							<h3>Who Should Participate?</h3>
							<p>							Participants should either be enrolled in a degree-granting arts program, have recently graduated from a program or have had to recently stop their studies due to COVID-19 related complications. Participants should also have a connection with another country outside of the one they are residing in—either through their parents, grandparents, etc—and are looking for new ways to engage with that homeland. Participants will work on self-directed projects over the course of two weeks culminating in a final presentation of the work done and where it will go.

								<br><br>
								Participants accepted into the program will be asked to place a $20 deposit and will recieve an additional $50 upon completion of the program and submission of materials for documentation. Applications who cannot afford to place the deposit can state so in their application.

						<h2>FAQ</h2>

						<h3>Is the program happening dependent on funding?</h3>
						<p>Funding helps create the program in it's most ideal way. Whether or not the funding comes through, the program will happen though it might change to account for how much is actually raised. <br><br> The most crucial part of funding that I'd like to make is at least the $500 to compensate participants.</p>

						<h3>Why is this program happening?</h3>
						<p>
							 I am currently a resident at Babycastles and my project revolves around reinterpreting stories passed down from my family members for the internet now that visiting my familiy members abroad is impossible. As part of my residency at Babycastles, I am asked to host a public program. DigiMyths is the program that birthed from the intersection of my residency and education.
							<br><br>
							Along with this, as an educator,  COVID-19 fully exposing the problems of academic institutions from its quick abandonment of students under financial duress, the inaccessibility for anyone but the most privileged, and the precarious state of part-time faculty, the desire for alternative learning spaces has become crucial.
							
							<br><br>

							This program seeks to create a first iteration of those alternative spaces.

						</p>

						<h3>Why is the program primarily for students in college or recently graduated students ?</h3>
						<p>
							With COVID-19 fully exposing the problems of academic institutions from its quick abandonment of students under financial duress, the inaccessibility for anyone but the most privileged, and the precarious state of part-time faculty, the desire for alternative learning spaces has become crucial. 
							
							<br><br> 
							Art School was already a difficult decision prior to COVID-19 and now been made hard to justify. As such the first irteration of DigiMyths is focused on serving this group and creating the first iteration of alternative learning spaces.
