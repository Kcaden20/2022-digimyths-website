						<h2>What is DigiMyths?</h2>
						<p>As first-generation citizens, third-culture kids, or others with a familial attachment to another country, this other place often exists as an idea in our own heads. Complicated even further by COVID-19, the place begins to fade as frequent summer trips become sporadic, and maintaining one’s heritage becomes harder. What is Digital Folklore? While it’s definitions are amorphous, one way to see it is as a manner reconnecting with that heritage through understanding customs, stories, and beliefs without the need for geo-physicality. Join Kevin Cadena, BabyCastles’ Digital Folklorist-in-Residence for a DigiMyths: a program on the intersection of digital technologies, heritage, and familial stories. 
							<br><br>
							The participants and instructor will convene on Zoom to start the program in early February, and to end the program in late February. During these two weeks, participants will research mythologies related to their homeland and/or culture, sketch out potential ideas melding computer technologies into these stories, produce drafts to actualize their concepts and create self-driven projects that explore their own interpretation of  Digital Folklore. To further supplement their projects, I will host a series of co-working sessions on Wednesdays between the two weeks for those who need time set aside and gather resources and materials that showcase some ways that artists have recontextualized their heritage through digital media. 
							<br><br>
							Participants should either be enrolled in a degree-granting arts program or have had to recently stop their studies due to COVID-19 related complications. Participants should also have a connection with another country outside of the one they are residing in—either through their parents, grandparents, etc—and are looking for new ways to engage with that homeland. Participants will work on self-directed projects over the course of two weeks culminating in a final presentation of the work done and where it will go.
